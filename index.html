<p>Let's explore the current problems in Jobmine with an example:</p>

<p>Bob applies to Google and Generic Company 5. He likes both, but like all of us his childhood dream is to work at Google. His interviews go really well, but he's still nervous. Bob knows everyone and their dog applies to Google. Google really likes Bob too, but they were even more impressed by SuperCoder man and his ability to type 5000 words per minute.</p>

<p>In the end Google decides to rank Bob second:</p>

<pre><code>1. Super-coder man
2. Bob
...
</code></pre>

<p>The day they release the results of the rankings Bob is sitting there refreshing his computer and this comes up:</p>

<pre><code>Google ............... Ranked
Generic Company 5 .... Offer
</code></pre>

<p>Bob is really proud of himself, <em>he got ranked by Google!</em> However, Bob has no idea whether he is ranked second or fifth and he's nervous that if he doesn't rank Generic Company 5 first he might not get a job at all. So that's what Bob does, he ranks both companies 1 (which guarantees he will end up at Generic Company). </p>

<p>SuperCoder Man meanwhile finally gets that position at the league of super co-op students he wanted, so he declines the Google position.</p>

<p>Now even though Bob would have preferred Google to any of the other companies and Google would have preferred Bob to any of the available candidates, they end up being separated. And it's all thanks to the Machinations of the Evil Job Mine Algorithm!</p>
