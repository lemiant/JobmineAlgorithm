<a name="whats-the-problem" class="anchor" href="#whats-the-problem"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's the problem?</h3>

<p>Let's explore the current problems in Jobmine with some examples:</p>

<h4>Bob's Dilemma</h4>

<p>Bob applies to Google and Generic Company. He likes both, but like all of us his childhood dream is to work at Google. His interviews go really well, but he's still nervous. Bob knows everyone and their dog applies to Google. Google really likes Bob too, but they were even more impressed by SuperCoder man and his ability to type 5000 words per minute.</p>

<p>In the end Google decides to rank Bob second:</p>

<pre><code>1. Super-coder man
2. Bob
...
</code></pre>

<p>The day they release the results of the rankings Bob is sitting there refreshing his computer and this comes up:</p>

<pre><code>Google ............... Ranked
Generic Company .... Offer
</code></pre>

<p>Bob is really proud of himself, <em>he got ranked by Google!</em> However, Bob has no idea whether he is ranked second or fifth and he's nervous that if he doesn't rank Generic Company first he might not get a job at all. So that's what Bob does, he ranks Generic Company #1 (which guarantees he will end up at Generic Company). </p>

<p>SuperCoder Man meanwhile finally gets that position at the league of super co-op students he wanted, so he declines the Google position.</p>

<p>Now even though Bob would have preferred Google to any of the other companies and Google would have preferred Bob to any of the available candidates, they end up being separated. And it's all thanks to the machinations of the Rank Match Algorithm!</p>
      
<h4>Poor Recruiters</h4>

<p>As a recruiter, choosing who to rank first is a big decision. If a student doesn't see "offer" from you when it comes to selection time they will likely take the safe road and choose someone else who did give them the offer.</p>

<p>This means that if a company has three top candidates and the person they extend the offer to declines them, they will likely lose the other top candidates as well. This makes it hard on companies and even encourages them to violate the rules of JobMine and contact their top students outside of the system to find out if they would accept the offerr.</p>

<p>I know many people and many companies for which this actually has happened. And it makes sense since this is exactly what the current system is forcing them to do.</p>

<h3>It's not just Bob</h3>

<p>These poor folks aren't on their own. Have you ever tried to explain how Rank Match works to someone? It's not easy to understand. Rank Match is very complicated and unintuitive. It puts a curtain between employers and coops sutdents that forces them to guess about each other's rankings if they want to get the best available choice.</p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>The solution is simple. Have companies rank all the students they want in order. Have all students rank the companies they want in order.
  If a company is looking for <i>n</i> students then the first n students will be given an offer. Any student who gets multiple offers will hold on to the one which they have ranked the highest and decline all the others.
  Any declined offer is then presented to the next student on the company's list.</p>
  
<p>If re-offering the declined offers causes anyone to have multiple offers again, they will once again keep the one they ranked highest and decline the rest. Repeat until everyone is holding one and only one offer.</p>

<p>This system is very straightforward. Every student is guaranteed to end up at the company they wanted most which also wanted them. Each company gets the students they wanted most who also wanted them.</p>

<p>No more having to guess what the other side is thinking in order to get a good match. No one will have to choose between ranking their dream company first and risking not getting a job.</p>

<p>Go back and look at the Bob/Google scenario under this system. Bob would rank Google first because there is no penalty for it (i.e. it won't hurt him for other jobs) and they would end up together :).</p>

<h3>What to do about it?</h3>

<p>Waterloo is currently working on a replacement for Jobmine called Waterloo Works, and they are looking for community feedback. If we work together we can replace the Rank Match Algorithm and make co-op better for everyone.</p>
