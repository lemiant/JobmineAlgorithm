<a name="whats-the-problem" class="anchor" href="#whats-the-problem"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What's the problem?</h3>

<p>Let's explore the current problems in Jobmine with some examples:</p>

<h4>Bob's Dilemma</h4>

<p>Bob applies to Google and Random Company. He likes both, but like all of us his childhood dream is to work at Google. His interviews go really well, but he's still nervous. Bob knows everyone and their dog applies to Google. Google really likes Bob too, but they were even more impressed by SuperCoder man and his ability to type 5000 words per minute.</p>

<p>In the end Google decides to rank Bob second:</p>

<pre><code>1. SuperCoder man
2. Bob
...
</code></pre>

<p>The day they release the results of the rankings Bob is sitting there refreshing his computer and this comes up:</p>

<pre><code>Google ............... Ranked
Random Company ....... Offer
</code></pre>

<p>Bob is really proud of himself, <em>he got ranked by Google!</em> However, Bob has no idea whether he is ranked second or fifth and he's nervous that if he doesn't rank Random Company first he might not get a job at all. So that's what Bob does, he ranks Random Company #1 (which guarantees he will end up at Random Company). </p>

<p>SuperCoder Man, meanwhile, finally gets that position at the league of super co-op students he wanted, so he declines the Google position.</p>

<p>Now even though Bob would have preferred Google to any of the other companies and Google would have preferred Bob to any of the available candidates, they end up being separated. And it's all thanks to the problems of the Rank Match Algorithm!</p>
      
<h4>Bad for Companies too</h4>

<p>For a company, choosing who to rank first is a big decision. If a student doesn't see "offer" from them when it comes to selection time the student will likely take the safe road and choose someone else, even if that company was their top choice.</p>

<p>This means that if a company has three top candidates and the person they extend the offer to declines them, they will likely lose the other top candidates as well. This makes it hard on companies. It encourages good companies to leave JobMine or to violate the rules of JobMine and contact their top students outside of the system. Presenting offers to top students before deciding who to pick on JobMine has become common practice even though it is strictly against the rules.</p>

<p>I know many people and many companies for which this has actually happened. And it makes sense since this is exactly what the current system is forcing them to do.</p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>The solution is simple. Match up the best jobs with the best students!</p>

<p>No more fancy ranking method where you can have four companies ranked #1. Just rank companies in the order that you want them:</p>

<pre><code>SuperCoder man's Rankings:
1. League of Super Co-ops
2. Google

Bob's Rankings:
1. Google
2. Random Company
</code></pre>

<p>Then the companies rank students in order:</p>

<pre><code>Google's Rankings:
1. SuperCoder man
2. Bob

Random Company's Rankings:
1. Bob
...

League of Super Co-ops' Rankings:
1. SuperCoder man
...
</code></pre>

<p>Now we run the our new matching algorithm with that data. First the top ranked student for each job gets the offer. SuperCoder man ends up with an offer from <i>The League</i> and one from Google. He keeps the offer he wanted most (<i>The League</i>) and returns the rest. Here's what it looks like after the first pass:</p>

<pre><code>SuperCoder man:
1. League of Super Co-ops (Offer)
2. Google (Returned offer)

Bob:
1. Google
2. Random Company (Offer)
</code></pre>

<p>Now any returned offers are given to the second ranked coop student. This means that the Google offer gets passed on to Bob. Now Bob has more than one offer so he keeps the Google one and returns the rest: </p>

<pre><code>SuperCoder man:
1. League of Super Co-ops (Offer)
2. Google (Returned offer)

Bob:
1. Google (Offer)
2. Random Company (Returned offer)
</code></pre>

<p>This process is repeated over and over until each coop student is holding a single offer - that's their coop job. Fortunately this can all be done automatically, because the computer can look at any two offers and determine which the student would prefer using the rankings that student submitted.</p>

<p>This system is very straightforward. Every student is guaranteed to end up at the best company available to them. Each company gets the best student available to them. No more having to guess what the other side is thinking in order to get a good match. No one will have to choose between ranking their dream company first and risking not getting a job.</p>

<p>Compare the outcomes for Bob and in this scenario with the current Rank Match algorithm. Bob got his first ranked job instead of his second, without having to risk getting no job. And Google was able to get their second choice instead of their third. Everyone was better off. In fact this solution - which I'm going to call SimpleMatch - performs as well as or better than the existing Rank Match algorithm in all situations. As an added bonus students no longer have to try and guess what companies are going to do and companies no longer need to break the rules to contact students outside of the system.</p>

<h3>What to do about it?</h3>

<p>Waterloo is currently working on a replacement for Jobmine called Waterloo Works, and they are looking for community feedback. If we work together we can replace the Rank Match algorithm and make co-op better for everyone. Enter your name and uwaterloo.ca email below to sign the petition for a better Jobmine.</p>
